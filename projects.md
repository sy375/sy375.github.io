## Nonlinear Feedback Shift Registers
During Wolfram Summer School, I have conducted a research on Nonlinear Feedback Shift Registers (NFSRs). I have formulated functions to test whether certain combinations of tap positions and nonlinear function produce the sequence of maximal length, which is length 2^n-1 (n is the length of the shift register). This is because there are only there are 2^n possible states and the sequence of all 0s cannot evolve to any new state. I tested all NFSRs with 2 taps and 3 taps for n<16, and all NFSRs with 4 taps for n<10. (Some notable nonlinear feedback functions were further tested with bigger length). I then ran several statistical randomness tests such as the equidistribution test, the serial test, and the poker test, to identify combinations that produce random sequences. I also made some analyses of the tap positions and nonlinear functions that produce long random sequences. The following function give the list of 3-tap nonlinear feedback shift registers that produce sequences of maximal length.
