## Nonlinear Feedback Shift Registers
During Wolfram Summer School, I have conducted a research on Nonlinear Feedback Shift Registers (NFSRs). I have formulated functions to test whether certain combinations of tap positions and nonlinear function produce the sequence of maximal length, which is length 2^n-1 (n is the length of the shift register). This is because there are only there are 2^n possible states and the sequence of all 0s cannot evolve to any new state. I tested all NFSRs with 2 taps and 3 taps for n<16, and all NFSRs with 4 taps for n<10. (Some notable nonlinear feedback functions were further tested with bigger length). I then ran several statistical randomness tests such as the equidistribution test, the serial test, and the poker test, to identify combinations that produce random sequences. I also made some analyses of the tap positions and nonlinear functions that produce long random sequences. The following function give the list of 3-tap nonlinear feedback shift registers that produce sequences of maximal length.

## Riemann-zeta Function and Analytic Continuation
For this research, I have studied about Riemann-zeta function and its analytic continuation. Riemann-zeta function is widely used in statistics, physics, and mostly importantly, in analytic number theory. This function provides so much valuable information linking the distribution of prime numbers. However, in order to understand this function beyond some domain, we need to learn about the analytic continuation of this function, which requires implementation of complex analysis. The tools we learned during the course, such as integral over complex contour, Residue Theorem, Liouvilleâ€™s Theorem, and etc. were essential in understanding how the analytic continuation is performed and what kind of characters related functions have.
