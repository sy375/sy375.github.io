# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Sung Min Yoon`. I am a originally from South Korea and I enjoy playing all kinds of sports, including Basketball, Soccer, and Tennis.

I have received my B.A. in Mathematics and Economics from Cornell University in May 2022. I am continuing my study at Cornell University in the Master of Financial Engineering program, which I will be completing in December 2022.
