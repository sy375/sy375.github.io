<p>
I am a Master of Financial Engineering Student at Cornell University. Prior to this, I received by Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Economics (Double Major) at Cornell University. On campus, I worked as an equity research associate at Cayuga Fund, which is a student-run fund focusing on small-cap stocks, and I covered the energy sector of the fund. In my free time, I enjoyed playing Basketball, Soccer, and Tennis.
